; Toggles the A20 line using the Fast A20 method (System Control Port 0x92)
[GLOBAL IAPX86.A20.Toggle.Fast]
F16.A20.Toggle.Fast:
	; This function, while called the Fast A20 method, is actually quite slow,
	; and on some systems is dangerous. This function is the least recommended
	; of all of the functions we use to toggle the A20 line. What this function
	; does is outputs a value through the system control port 0x92. The problem
	; with this method is that on some computers it is unsupported, while on
	; other computers it may do something entirely different (such as clearing
	; the screen or eating your laundry). Therefore, we should only use this
	; method if we have no other choice.
