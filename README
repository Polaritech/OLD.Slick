Slick - An operating system based off of an extensible micro-exokernel.

Slick is an operating system kernel, as well as the name of the umbrella
project comprising of the kernel, bootloader, and drivers. It is designed to
be an exensible microkernel that limits the amount of abstraction required to
write and run an application. The premise behind this idea is that software can
still be written to take advantage of existing abstractions and frameworks,
while still having the flexibility to access lower-level components to increase
performance without sacrificing stability and safety.

The umbrella project contains the following components:
  - GLOSS ~ Generic Loader for Operating SystemS
            This is an extensible bootloader that supports configuration files
            per-OS, which reduces the need for the OS to support boot routines.
  - SLICK ~ System Level Integrated Computer Kernel
            This is the core microkernel which the operating system is built
            upon.
